# plfs

Pure Lua FileSystem

## Goal

The goal is write a pure lua module (without dependencies) for access to
filesystem using commands of the OS that are running. The use cases are
oriented to low level performance, when you needs access to file system
sporadically.

## ToDo

Baby steps to the goal

- [ ] Examples of use
- [ ] API like lfs
- [ ] Optimize work with strings
- [ ] Check under different versions of windows
- [ ] Check under different distros of GNU/Linux
